# Complex-Numbers
# Complex Number Operations

This Python program performs various arithmetic operations on complex numbers. It can add, subtract, multiply, divide, and calculate the modulus of two complex numbers while ensuring that the output is formatted correctly up to two decimal places.

## Features

- Addition of two complex numbers

- Subtraction of two complex numbers

- Multiplication of two complex numbers

- Division of two complex numbers

- Modulus of complex numbers

## Input Format

The program expects two lines of input, where each line contains the real and imaginary parts of a complex number separated by a space. 

For example:
2 1
5 6

In this example, `2 + 1i` is the first complex number, and `5 + 6i` is the second complex number.

## Output Format

The program outputs the results of the following operations on the complex numbers:
1. Addition
2. Subtraction
3. Multiplication
4. Division
5. Modulus of the first complex number
6. Modulus of the second complex number

Each output is formatted as follows:

- Complex numbers: `A + Bi` (or `A - Bi` if B < 0)

- Real numbers: `A + 0.00`

- Imaginary numbers: `0.00 + Bi` (or `0.00 - Bi` if B < 0)

For example, the output for the input above would be:

7.00+7.00i

-3.00-5.00i

4.00+17.00i

0.26-0.11i

2.24+0.00i

7.81+0.00i


## How to Run the Program

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine (version 3.x).
2. Clone this repository or download the `complex_numbers.py` file.
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the `complex_numbers.py` file.
4. Run the program using the command:

   `python complex_numbers.py`
